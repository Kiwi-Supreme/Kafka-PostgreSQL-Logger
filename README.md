# Real-time Kafka Message Logger with PostgreSQL

This is a basic project that demonstrates real-time message streaming using **Apache Kafka** and **PostgreSQL**.

In this project, users can **input a message**, which is then:
1. **Sent to a Kafka topic** using a Kafka producer.
2. **Read by a Kafka consumer**.
3. **Stored in a PostgreSQL database** for future access and analysis.

The steps followed to make this process happen are clearly explained in the file named **`Steps.docx`** included in this repository.
